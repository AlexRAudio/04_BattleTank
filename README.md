# BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head tank game, using Unreal Engine 4, with simple AI, terrain, and an advanced control system.

This file was created by following the Udemy Unreal Engine course, which can be found [here] (https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/)

I have taken this course on as a sound designer and a composer to further my knowledge on game development, programming and using Unreal Engine's API.
